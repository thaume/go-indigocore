## Change log

### 0.23.1-alpha
* `strat update` will now properly check the cryptographic signature of
  downloaded binaries.

### 0.23.0-alpha
* `strat update` will now check the cryptographic signature of
  downloaded binaries.

### 0.22.0-alpha
* All releases binaries are now signed.

### 0.21.0-alpha
* Added `strat` command `down` that executes a project script that
  should stop running services.
* Added `strat` command `pull` that executes a project script that
  should pull updates.
* Added `strat` command `push` that executes a project script that
  should push updates.

### 0.20.0-alpha
* Use `logrus` as the logger.

### 0.19.0-alpha
* Fixed `strat` `down:test` not working.
* Made `strat` support private Github repositories on repository
  commands via a flag or environment variable.

### 0.18.0-alpha
* Added support for `strat` `down:test` script. This addition makes
  `strat test` execute a `down:test` script if present after the tests.
  It will handle the exit code properly.
* Added ability for `strat` scripts to accept extra arguments.
  This change makes it possible to pass arguments (both flags and
  parameters) to a script when executing it.
* Improved code documentation.

### 0.17.0-alpha
* Scripts executed by `strat` can now be OS and architecture
  specific. It will look fist for a script named
  `{name}:{os}:{arch}`, then `{name}:{os}`, then `{name}:{arch}`,
  and finally `{name}`.
* Added the `strat build` command that executes the `build`
  script of a project.

### 0.16.0-alpha
* Scripts executed by `strat` are now passed to a shell instead
  of being executed directly. On*nix, the shell is `sh`. On
  Windows it is `cmd` (needs to be tested). This is to allow
  executing multiple commands in a script, for instance using
  `&&`.
*  Scripts executed by `strat` are now passed a working directory
  and can optionally return a success status if the script
  doesn't exist.
*  Project files `stratumn.json` can now specify an `init` script
  that will be executed after `strat generate` generates the
  project files.
* Changed the way the CLI updates itself in order to make it
  work on Windows (hopefully). The old binary will be renamed
  instead of attempting to override it. If an old binary is
  found during launch, it will attempt to remove it (it will
  fail if it doesn't have the right permissions, but it will
  not stop execution of the command).
* CLI and generators must now be updated separately using
  `strat update` and `strat update -generators` respectively.
  This is because the two operations might require different user
  permissions depending on the environment.
* Added a `-force` flag to `strat` to force an update. This is
  mostly designed to test the update mechanism easily.
* Added a function called `secret` to generator templates to create
  random strings.
* Fixed an issue when updating generators.
* Fixed an issue when downloading generators on Windows.
* Fixed some Windows compatibility issues.
* Fixed a problem when updating generators that would result in the
  generators not being saved to the correct directory.

### 0.15.0-alpha
* Command `strat update` will now update the CLI. It will update to the
  latest published release by default, or the latest prerelease if
  `-prerelease` is set.
* Command `strat update` will now update all known generators instead of just
  the default repository.
* Generator repositories now refer to Github references (usually a branch)
  instead of release tags. This approach is more flexible and makes
  maintaining generators easier.
* Commands `strat up` and `strat test` will now properly output errors.
* Commands `strat up` and `strat test` will now properly handle user input.
* Commands `strat up` and `strat test` will now shutdown cleanly and wait for
  the script to terminate.
* Added command `strat run script` that executes a project script.
